These are some of the tests that were created for the checkpoint 3. 
However, a lot of extra tests (made by ourselves) can be found in the folder: "comp2020-2f\test\fixtures\public\fail"
Those were made in order to test semantic checks that were implemented and were not being tested by the given test files.
